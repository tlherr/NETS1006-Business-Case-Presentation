Project Description:

Imagine your group is a consultancy team that has been asked to build a business case for the design and implementation of a HA / DR design for a small- to medium-sized business. You might choose one of the following examples, or you can ask your instructor to approve a different idea.
    * Chain of restaurants: 4 restaurants in a single metropolitan region
    * Independent travel agency: 4 travel agents plus 3 support staff
    * Software consultancy providing software-as-a-service for larger enterprises: 35 staff including development, testing, implementation, service provision, sales, marketing, finance etc.
    * Medical clinic: 4 doctors, 6 other health care providers (e.g. chiropractic, RMT, physiotherapy), 8 support staff
    * Others: discuss with instructor; you may not use examples from the Dependency Diagrams Assignment.

Build a written business case and a class presentation to describe the enterprise and its HA / DR business requirements. Using dependency diagrams (see text ch.4 and your assignment) and failure scenario selection (text ch. 2 & 4) and risk matrices (article, assignment), show how your team recommends the business should satisfy those needs. Describe the risks (financial, legal/contractual, regulatory, reputational, process & procedural, moral/ethical) and how your design mitigates them. Describe the hard and soft costs to the enterprise of implementing the plan compared with the hard and soft costs of the risks. Discuss failure scenarios that are not being dealt with, and why. Carefully document your sources of information, including costs!
Students will work in self-selected groups of 5-6 persons. Your group must differ from the first project.
Presentations will be limited to 10 minutes, plus time for Q&A from class and other attendees. Written submissions should be in the range of 2,000-3,000 words, plus table of contents, references and other tables, diagrams and/or illustrations.

Interim dates:
- Group selection by week 7
- Case selection by week 8; assignment of presentation dates in week 8
Class work time will be available in weeks 8, 9, 10 & 11.
